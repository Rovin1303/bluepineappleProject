# 🚀 **BluePineapple Campus Connect: Sorting Algorithm Visualizer**

This project was developed as part of the **BluePineapple Campus Connect** program.
Our team's goal was to create an interactive web application to **visualize common sorting algorithms**, making it easier to understand their step-by-step processes.

---

## 📘 **Project Description**

This web application provides a **dynamic visualization** of various sorting algorithms.
Users can:

* Select an algorithm
* Generate a set of random bars (representing array elements)
* Observe how the algorithm rearranges them in real-time

The visualization helps in understanding the **logic, comparisons, and swaps** involved in each sorting method.

---

## ✨ **Features**

* 🔢 **Algorithm Selection**: Choose between different sorting algorithms (e.g., *Bubble Sort*, *Insertion Sort*)
* 📊 **Dynamic Visualization**: Watch bars change height and position as the algorithm executes
* ⏱️ **Adjustable Speed**: Control the animation speed to observe the steps clearly
* 📐 **Customizable Array Size**: Generate arrays of varying sizes to see performance differences
* 🕹️ **Interactive Controls**: Buttons for generating new arrays, starting, pausing, and resetting the visualization

---

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

### **Frontend**

* **HTML5**: For structuring the web content
* **CSS3**: For styling and visual presentation of the elements and animations
* **JavaScript**: For implementing the sorting algorithms, controlling the visualization logic, and handling user interactions
