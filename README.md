BluePineapple Campus Connect: Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
This project was developed as part of the BluePineapple Campus Connect program. Our team's goal was to create an interactive web application to visualize common sorting algorithms, making it easier to understand their step-by-step processes.

Project Description
This web application provides a dynamic visualization of various sorting algorithms. Users can select an algorithm, generate a set of random bars (representing array elements), and observe how the algorithm rearranges them in real-time. The visualization helps in understanding the logic, comparisons, and swaps involved in each sorting method.

Features
Algorithm Selection: Choose between different sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort).

Dynamic Visualization: Watch bars change height and position as the algorithm executes.

Adjustable Speed: Control the animation speed to observe the steps clearly.

Customizable Array Size: Generate arrays of varying sizes to see performance differences.

Interactive Controls: Buttons for generating new arrays, starting, pausing, and resetting the visualization.

Technologies Used
Frontend:

HTML5: For structuring the web content.

CSS3: For styling and visual presentation of the elements and animations.

JavaScript: For implementing the sorting algorithms, controlling the visualization logic, and handling user interactions.
